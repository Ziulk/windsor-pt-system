# MVP Launch Plan

## Start Smaller: Validate Before You Scale

**Goal:** Get the **first 3 paying clients** using the smallest possible system:
- One focused landing page
- - Calendly for booking
  - - Stripe for payments
   
    - No portal, no CRM, no community, no automation yet. Just proof that strangers will pay you.

                          ### Step 1 – Warm Network
                          - Contact 15–30 people via DM/text
                          - - "Hey [Name], I'm taking on 3 clients for an 8‑week transformation in Windsor. Want details?"

                            - - Post 3–5 times on one platform (Instagram/Facebook/LinkedIn)
                              - - Every post points to: **Book a free consult** with Calendly link
                               
                                - ### Step 3 – Referrals

                                  - - Offer free session if they refer someone who signs up
                                   
                                    - ---

                                        ## 5. When to Move to Full System

                                        Only start building the full Claude system when you have:
                                        - 3–5 paying clients on the same offer
                                        - - You can book consults when you try
                                          - - You're busy enough that automation would save time
